### Problem statement:

```
We need to develop software for automating various activities of a small bookshop. From a
discussion with the owner of the bookshop, the following user requirements have been arrived at:

BAS should help the customers query whether a book is in stock. The users can query the availability of a book either by using the book title or the author's name. If the bookshop is not currently selling the book, then the customer is asked to enter full details of the book for
procurement of the book in future. If a book is in stock, the exact number of copies available and the
rack number in which the book is located should be displayed. If a book is not in stock, the query for
the book is used to increment a request field. The manager can periodically view the
request field of the books to arrive at a rough estimate regarding the current demand for different
books. BAS should maintain the price of various books. As soon as a customer selects a book for
purchase, the sales clerk enters the book's ISBN number. BAS should update the stock and
generate the sales receipt for the book. BAS should allow employees to update the inventory whenever
a new supply arrives. Also, upon request, BAS should generate sales statistics (viz., book name,
publisher, ISBN, number of copies sold, and the sales revenue) for any period. The sales
statistics will help the owner know the exact business done over time and
determine the inventory level required for various books. The inventory level needed for a book is
equal to the number of copies sold over two weeks multiplied by the average
number of days it takes to procure the book from its publisher. Every day the bookshop owner would
give a command for the BAS to print the books which have fallen below the threshold and the number
of copies to be procured along with the full address of the publisher.
